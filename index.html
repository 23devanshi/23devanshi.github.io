				<p>My origin roots back to the city of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, but I have since lived in, and been shaped by, seven different cities. <br>
					Presently, I am based out of Bangalore, where I work for an analytics consulting startup. <br><br>
					An economist by training, I am currently navigating to the world of data science. I am particularly interested in using data to make better decisions. <br><br>
					I constantly incorporate habits and routines to become a better me. Meditation, exercise and clean eating. <br><br>
					In my spare time, you will either find me planning a trip, reading a book, or watching a TV series (in reverse order of frequency). You'll find what occupies me currently at my <a href="/now">Now</a> page. </p>
